## Linear Algebra Lecture Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on Linear Algebra, based on the textbook:

- **Gilbert Strang**, _Introduction to Linear Algebra_, 6th edition.

These notes are also supplemented by the [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/) from Spring 2005, taught by Professor Gilbert Strang.
